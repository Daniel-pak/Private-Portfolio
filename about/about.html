            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>I started self teaching coding 3 years ago while attending St. John's University. While the Sciences used to be my passion, coding and the ability to create a fully functional application within hours soon overtook that as my main focus. Since then, I've decided to take time away from working to put all of my time into web developement. I joined V School and have been coding every day since! In addition to the skills I possess, I am also learning Swift and deep learning with Python. I don't have a vast amount of projects to show as yet, however, there is much more to come!</p>
